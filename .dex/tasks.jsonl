It determines correctness by checking if the user's move still leads to mate in N moves, and it plays realistic opponent responses (best defense) rather than scripted lines.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Stockfish Worker (src/lib/stockfish.ts)\n- Load stockfish WASM ('lite' variant ~7MB for mobile perf) in a Web Worker\n- UCI protocol initialization: send 'uci', wait for 'uciok', send 'isready', wait for 'readyok'\n- Create a promise-based API wrapping the postMessage/onmessage pattern\n- Key methods:\n  - analyze(fen, depth): returns {bestMove, score, mateIn}\n  - getBestMove(fen): returns the best move string\n  - stop(): cancel ongoing analysis\n  - isReady(): check engine state\n\n### 2. UCI Response Parsing\n- Parse 'bestmove e2e4' responses\n- Parse 'info depth N score mate M' for mate detection\n- Parse 'info depth N score cp C' for centipawn evaluation\n- Extract PV (principal variation) lines for the analysis display\n\n### 3. useStockfish Hook (src/hooks/useStockfish.ts)\n- Manages engine lifecycle (init, ready state, cleanup on unmount)\n- Exposes: validateMove(fen, requiredMateIn) → {isCorrect, bestMove, evaluation}\n- Exposes: getOpponentMove(fen) → bestMove string\n- Loading state while engine initializes\n- Error handling for WASM load failures (fallback to non-engine mode)\n\n### 4. Move Validation Logic\n- After user moves, send new FEN to engine at depth 15\n- Check if 'score mate N' exists where N ≤ required moves remaining\n- If mate found → move is correct\n- If no forced mate → move is incorrect, puzzle marked failed\n- Edge case: user delivers checkmate directly (no engine needed, chess.js detects it)\n\n## Done When\n- Engine loads in Web Worker without blocking main thread\n- analyze() returns correct mate evaluations for known positions\n- Opponent best-move responses are reasonable (defends well)\n- Engine gracefully handles rapid position changes (stop previous analysis)\n- Fallback mode works when engine fails to load","priority":1,"completed":true,"result":"Stockfish engine integration complete.

Worker Lifecycle\n- Constructor takes the path to the stockfish JS file (default: '/stockfish/stockfish-nnue-17.1-lite-single-[hash].js')\n- `init()`: create Worker, send 'uci', wait for 'uciok', send 'isready', wait for 'readyok'\n- `dispose()`: send 'quit', terminate worker\n- Handle Worker creation errors gracefully (WASM not supported, file not found)\n\n### 2. UCI Communication Layer\n- Internal message queue/promise pattern: send command → collect output lines → resolve when terminal response received\n- Terminal responses: 'uciok' (for 'uci'), 'readyok' (for 'isready'), 'bestmove ...' (for 'go')\n- Stream 'info' lines during analysis to capture the best evaluation seen\n\n### 3. UCI Response Parsing (pure functions, export for testing)\n- `parseBestMove(line: string)`: extract move from 'bestmove e2e4 ponder f7f5'\n- `parseInfoLine(line: string)`: extract depth, score (mate/cp), pv from 'info depth 15 seldepth 20 score mate 2 pv e2e4 e7e5 d1h5'\n- Score types: 'score mate N' (forced mate in N full moves) vs 'score cp C' (centipawn advantage)\n- PV extraction: the 'pv' token followed by move list until end of line\n- Handle edge cases: 'bestmove (none)', missing score, incomplete info lines\n\n### 4. analyze() Method\n- Stop any ongoing analysis first (send 'stop' if busy)\n- Send 'position fen <fen>'\n- Send 'go depth <depth>' (default 15)\n- Collect info lines, track the highest-depth result with score\n- Resolve promise when 'bestmove' line arrives\n- Return the best AnalysisResult seen\n\n### 5.

User makes move\n2. Apply move to chess.js board\n3. Send position to Stockfish: `position fen <new_fen>`\n4. Request analysis: `go depth 15`\n5. Parse `bestmove` and `score mate N` from output\n6. If mate in ≤ required moves exists → move is correct\n7. If no forced mate → move is incorrect (mark puzzle failed)\n\n### Opponent Response\n\n1. After valid user move (not checkmate)\n2. Stockfish already computed best defense\n3. Apply best move to board\n4. Animate piece movement\n5. User's turn again\n\n### Fallback (Engine Disabled)\n\n- Validate first move against `moves` field in JSON\n- Auto-play opponent responses from solution\n- Less flexible but works offline/low-power devices\n\n---\n\n## Move Format Conversion\n\nThe JSON uses `from-to` format (e.g., `f6-g7`).

Board Glow / Border Feedback\n- Correct move: board border briefly pulses green, then returns to default\n- Incorrect move: board border briefly pulses red, then persists subtly\n- Puzzle solved (complete + no failures): board has persistent green border\n- Failed but completed: board has persistent red border\n- CSS transitions for smooth glow animation (~500ms pulse)\n\n### 2. Toast Notifications\n- Correct move: '✓ Correct! Opponent plays...' in green-bordered toast (per states_1.png)\n- Incorrect move: '✗ Not the best move. Keep playing to explore.' in red-bordered toast\n- Toasts appear between timer and move list\n- Auto-dismiss after ~2-3 seconds, or on next action\n- Minimal animation (fade in/out)\n\n### 3.

Includes basic layout and dark theme CSS — enough to be functional and visually reasonable, not pixel-perfect (that comes in later tasks).\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. App.tsx\n- Load puzzles on mount (loadPuzzles() from lib/puzzles.ts)\n- Show loading state while puzzles fetch\n- Initialize usePuzzle with loaded puzzles + current puzzle ID from useAppState\n- Render:\n  - Board component with props from usePuzzle (fen, orientation, turnColor, dests, etc.)\n  - Puzzle info: number/total, type, side to move (simple text, not the full PuzzleInfo component yet)\n  - Timer display (MM:SS from usePuzzle.formattedTime)\n  - Move history (simple numbered list of SAN moves)\n  - Next button (enabled only in COMPLETE phase)\n  - Status text (playing / solved / failed)\n\n### 2. Basic Layout (src/styles/app.css)\n- Dark background (#1a1a2e or similar)\n- Desktop: flexbox row — board left, info panel right\n- Mobile: stacked — board on top, info below (media query at ~768px)\n- Board sizing: max 600px desktop, 100% width mobile\n- Basic typography: system font stack, white text on dark\n- Button styles for Next button\n- Minimal but clean — doesn't need to match mockups exactly yet\n\n### 3. Chessground CSS\n- Import chessground base CSS\n- Import or configure board/piece theme\n- Ensure board renders correctly within the layout\n\n### 4. Verification Flow\nTest the following manually:\n1. App loads → puzzle 1 appears on board\n2. Board oriented correctly (white at bottom for \"White to Move\")\n3. Legal moves highlighted when clicking a piece\n4. Make correct first move → opponent auto-plays from solution\n5. Deliver checkmate → timer stops, status changes to solved/failed\n6. Click Next → puzzle 2 loads\n7. Make wrong move → puzzle marked failed, can still play\n8. Refresh browser → progress persisted (same puzzle, previous results saved)\n\n## Done When\n- Full puzzle flow works end-to-end in the browser\n- Board renders and accepts moves\n- Timer counts up and stops on completion\n- Move history shows in the panel\n- Next button advances to next puzzle\n- State persists across page reloads\n- Dark theme applied, layout is reasonable on desktop and mobile\n- No console errors\n- TypeScript compiles cleanly","priority":1,"completed":true,"result":"Created full App.tsx integration + src/styles/app.css dark theme.

Board Component (src/components/Board.tsx)\n- Mount Chessground instance into a container div\n- Configure with:\n  - fen: current position\n  - orientation: 'white' or 'black' based on puzzle's 'first' field\n  - turnColor: whose turn it is\n  - movable: { free: false, color: side to move, dests: legal moves map }\n  - draggable: { enabled: true }\n  - animation: { enabled: true, duration: 200 }\n- Event handlers:\n  - onMove(orig, dest): callback to usePuzzle.makeMove()\n  - Handle promotion: detect pawn reaching last rank, default to queen (or show picker)\n- Update Chessground config reactively when FEN/state changes\n- Cleanup on unmount (cg.destroy())\n\n### 2. Legal Move Highlighting\n- Compute legal moves from chess.js: chess.moves({ verbose: true })\n- Convert to Chessground dests format: Map<Square, Square[]>\n- Update dests on each position change\n- Disable interaction during VALIDATING and OPPONENT_TURN phases\n\n### 3. Opponent Move Animation\n- When engine returns opponent move, apply to Chessground with animation\n- Use cg.move(from, to) for animated piece movement\n- Brief delay (~300ms) before opponent moves for natural feel\n\n### 4.
